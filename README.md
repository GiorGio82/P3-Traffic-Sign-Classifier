## Project: Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Program
[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

Overview
---
In this project, I used a deep neural networks with three convolutional layers to classify traffic signs. I trained and validated a model so it can classify traffic sign images using the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). After initial training the model is used to predict unseen images that I personally took



The Project
---
The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Load the data set
* Explore, summarize and visualize the data set
* Design, train and test a model architecture
* Use the model to make predictions on new images
* Analyze the softmax probabilities of the new images
* Summarize the results with a written report

### Start from here
Here is a link to my [project code](https://github.com/GiorGio82/P3-Traffic-Sign-Classifier/blob/master/Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb)

The html that shows the execution of the entire code is called `Traffic_Sign_Classifier.html` and it is available [here](https://github.com/GiorGio82/P3-Traffic-Sign-Classifier/blob/master/Traffic_Sign_Classifier.html)
