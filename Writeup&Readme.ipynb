    "A simple exploratory visualization of the data set uses an horizontal bar chart. Each plot shows the distrbution of classes, sorted by class sizes. The different plots indicate that the training data set is relatively unbalanced with some classes counting as little as 180 images while the class with most of the images counts 2010 images. All plots show the same unbalance for the other datasets (validation and testing) and all plot show a similar distribution.\n",

    "### Design and Test a Model Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Describe how you preprocessed the image data. What techniques were chosen and why did you choose these techniques? Consider including images showing the output of each preprocessing technique. Pre-processing refers to techniques such as converting to grayscale, normalization, etc. (OPTIONAL: As described in the \"Stand Out Suggestions\" part of the rubric, if you generated additional data for training, describe why you decided to generate additional data, how you generated the data, and provide example images of the additional data. Then describe the characteristics of the augmented training set like number of images in the set, number of images for each class, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "As a first step, I decided to read the original article from [LeCun](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/sermanet-ijcnn-11.pdf) because to me converting traffic signs grayscale sounded counterintuitive. The authors confirms my initial doubts but show empirically why grayscale images boost the model performance. To convert the datasets to grayscale I used the function `cv.cvtColor(image, cv.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)` from opencv that was already used in previous projects. An example of transformation from RGB to grayscale is shown in [Fig.N](#preprocessing_one_image). \n",
    "\n",
    "As learned in the classroom, pixel normalisation and centering around zero are essential pre-processing steps to help the model to learn. Normalisation makes sure that all the features of the dataset have similar range, while centering helps the optimiser. I tested different approaches for normalisation and centering and obrained the best results with a 'global normalisation'. That is, first I calculated both the mean and std of the entire dataset and then I subtracted the pixels by the mean divided by the std. The centring and normalisation process is done by the function `normalize_input`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step is applying histogram equalization to all images to improve their contrast and visibility. To do so I have used the openCV class [CLAHE](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d5/daf/tutorial_py_histogram_equalization.html). The [figure XX](#clahe_effect) shows a (color) image that is particularly dark next to the grayscale version and the same image after applying histogram equalization filter. The function used to convert to grayscale and to apply histogram equalization to an image dataset is `applyEqualizationAndGray`.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a name=\"clahe_effect\"> <img src=\"./writeup_images/histogram_equalization_image_12358.png\" alt=\"drawing\" style=\"width:400px;\"/> </a>\n",
    "\n",
    "I decided to generate additional data because the performance (validation and testing accuracy) that obtained with the original training set were below the target threshold of 93% and the results were showing overfitting behaviour (training accuracy higher than validation and testing accuracy). [Overfitting can be contrasted in different ways](https://towardsdatascience.com/deep-learning-3-more-on-cnns-handling-overfitting-2bd5d99abe5d) such as data augmentation and introducing dropout. My first thought was to augment the traning data to balance the distribution of the dataset so that all classes have equal size (equal to the largest class of the original set). Then, when the dataset is balanced, I can use the same filters to augment the entire dataset by a certain percent. To do so I explored different filters and preprocessing functions from the [imaug](https://github.com/aleju/imgaug) and from openCV libraries. I also made sure that the new images introduced to the datasets were not a duplicate of an existing image.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find out what preprocessing filters I should use, I tested different filters combinations from the many available, generated new datasets of different sizes and run the model again. The function `augment` takes 5 inputs: (1) a table that indicates what classes need to be balanced (depending on their original size), (2) the dataset to augment, (3) the corresponding label array, (4) the sequence of filters to apply and (5) the augmentation factor in percent, where 0 means 'only balancing the classes, no additional augmenting' and 100 means 'balance all classes and augment by 100%, that is double the size of each class'. For example with augment factor = 100, a class with 180 images (the smallest class), gets balanced to the largest class first (that has 2010 images) and then it is also doubled so that the total number of unique images of the class will be 4020. With augment factor 100, all classes will have 4020 images as shown in the image below:\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The  `augment` function randomly selects a simple combination of one or two filters to apply to each image, it applies it and then it checks if the new processed-image already exists in the dataset, if it already exists, the image is discarded and a new image is generated. I tried several different filter combinations and I observed that applying filters that altered the image \"too much\" resulted in poor learning performance. For example filters suchas MedianBlur, GaussianBlur, AverageBlur or AdditiveGaussianNoise altered the images so much that the model performed very poorly. Also I decided not to flip the images. The final set of filters is shown in the code snipped below, it is very simple but it result in good performance (more than 96% of accuracy on the testing dataset):\n",
